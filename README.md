# Wordpress Toolbox

Wordpress tips/tricks/tools I'm gathering along the way while learning how to use it.

## Plugins

### [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/)

>  View debugging and performance information on database queries, hooks, conditionals, HTTP requests, redirects and more. 

I found this to be very useful for debugging a variety of things such as which hooks have been triggered, which theme files are used on the current page, what conditionals match it, et cetera.

### [Timber](https://wordpress.org/plugins/timber-library/)

> Helps you create themes faster with sustainable code. With Timber, you write HTML using Mustache-like Templates — http://timber.upstatement.com 

One of the first things I said to myself when I started learning Wordpress — there's gotta be a better way to write these templates. You can spread them across multiple tiny files, but that doesn't help with the fact that Wordpress templates are usually a soup of imperative code and HTML output, which can get unwieldy pretty fast either way. 

Timber lets you use your theme's `.php` files for code, and handle all markup in a declarative `.twig` template, which is peachy. Now I just have to figure out how my theme file should invite/coerce the user into installing _Timber_ along with it.

### [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)

> Customise WordPress with powerful, professional and intuitive fields.

ACF is mentioned in every second sentence on Wordpress development, and lots of themes and plugins mention they _play nicely_ with it. I still need to study it a bit to get what the fuss is about :-)

## Starter Themes

### [\_s](https://github.com/Automattic/_s)

> Hi. I'm a starter theme called \_s, or underscores, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for. — http://underscores.me/

I love this idea of ["A 1000-Hour Head Start"](http://themeshaper.com/2012/02/13/introducing-the-underscores-theme/).

### [Timber Starter Theme](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme)

It's the `_s` of Timber-land.
